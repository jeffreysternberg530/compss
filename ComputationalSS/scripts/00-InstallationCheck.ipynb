    "\n",
    "### Learning Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get comfortable opening a Jupyter notebook and running cells\n",
    "2. Learn the features and function in the Jupyter IDE (Interactive Programming Environment)\n",
    "3. Run some Python code! Understand what is happening when you run code in Jupyter\n",
    "4. Understand the file structure on your computer and how to traverse it using Python\n",
    "5. Make sure everything is set up correctly on your own computers \n",

    "Jupyter notebooks consist of cells. The cell we're reading now is formatted as a \"Markdown\" cell, and is used for text. How do we know it's a markdown cell? Look at the top of the window for a dropdown menu with options such as `Code`, `Markdown`, etc. Click on this cell and that dropdown menu should say `Markdown`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run Markdown cells, but more typically you will be running code cells. Running code, or other cells, in a Jupyter notebook is relatively easy. Click on the cell you wish to run. A call is a segment of text or code. The cell you're currently 'in' will be outlined in blue. Once you've clicked on your desired cell then either click the \"Play\" button in the toolbar above the code window or press CTRL+RETURN on your keyboard.\n",

    "* If you modify a notebook and you're happy with the modifications, create a checkpoint by saving the notebook. Look for the hard disk icon on the top left. This should look familiar to people who have used Word.\n",

    "Now that you know a little bit about the Jupyter environment, let's make sure Python is installed and learn about running code. \n",
    "To run Python code we need cells that are formatted as `\"Code\"` cells. A code cell has an `\"In [ ]:\"` to the left of the cell. You can run a code cell the same way you run other cells. When you run a code cell it might take a while to complete finish. You know that it is working in the background if there is a asterick in the brackets to the left: `\"In [*]\"`.\n",

    "\n",
    "During the semester we will try to build a community of practice around programming and its applications to research on questions important to the social sciences and humanities. One facet of this effort will be a shared repository of knowledge regarding bugs and Python itself. To that end, we ask that each time you get an error message, you create a new thread on the bCourses page for this course. We hope to see dialogue around its resolution as well as a record that we can refer back to later. \n",

The folder names are case sensitive. We did this earlier in class, so hopefully everyone has it set up correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relative path names use the syntax `../` to traverse the file structure on your computer. Two dots followed by a forwardslash, `../`, will move up one directory from the directory you are currently in. You can string these together to move up as far as you want, e.g., `../../../../`\n",

Using fresh ingredients and offering bottomless coffee, Allston Diner is one of my mainstays. On a Saturday or Sunday morning you have to go there extra early to get a spot, or wait outside with the other fanatics.***   \n",

    "> Allston Diner completely changed my view on chicken and waffles. I'll be honest, I was not a fan of chicken and waffles before Allston Diner, especially for breakfast. But after eating at Allston Diner, I am forever changed. The chicken was perfectly tender, the waffle was delicious, but that bacon gravy left me speechless. Yes, it's probably going to increase my chances of cardiovascular disease, but that's a chance I'm willing to take over and over again. If you're in Allston, come to Allston Diner! \n",

This place takes card so that is always a plus in my book. Also something to note is that they don't seat parties larger than 4 due to their kitchen size so be prepared! And they close a little earlier than other breakfast joints so keep that in mind.\n",
