Looking back in all the outings – the safari, the hikes, and today’s tour of the Cape – all these absolutely breathtakingly beautiful sights – I can’t help but wonder who has the privilege of seeing these sights? This question first occurred to me while hiking up Table Mountain. I found it interesting how most people hiking the mountain were White or Asian and most of them seemed like tourists, and I realized these</span><span style=\"background-color: white; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"> opportunities are most likely unavailable for the majority of South Africans because not only is it a monetary expense, but also a physical expense to climb up a mountain and to take the time off of work to spend it leisurely. Therefore, the population who would most likely have the privilege of these sights would be tourists - foreigners, people with money. </span></div>\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt;\">\\n<span style=\"background-color: white; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span></div>\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: center;\">\\n<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><img height=\"289\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/YHwwgsPbFPyDErCQYP0SC1AcUREPYra8K4YAbJSxRZlZR-Vv8FaP8ZSlGk0fT09WC8izL2DzdRc3wapBOzgBshokblm11dFyMkUnBUE2dmYZW6yMZZv2J_A8TRFVr4nVBHxrydFi\" style=\"-webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad); border: none; transform: rotate(0.00rad);\" width=\"387\" /></span></div>\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: center;\">\\n<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Above:</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"> Table Mountain</span></div>\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\">\\n<br /></div>\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt;\">\\n<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Cape Town is becoming more of a tourist destination, and I can see how easily the beauty of Cape Town can fool foreigners into seeing it only as a paradise. From immediately stepping out of the airport, Table Mountain is waiting to greet its visitors. As a student, I came here specifically to study the social issues, but upon arriving and aware of the struggles South Africa deals with, I was immediately swept away by its beauty, and I felt reluctant to expose the social issues that would also be prevalent here. </span></div>\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt;\">\\n<br /></div>\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: center;\">\\n<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><img height=\"187\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/R-NJqF3ykB-rCxj7jLQgmgsTg3YjtZqFLCUonT8hhYFzA_-NMSlNp6g-MW4Tl5Vsh82hxWaWz9HRcDhhaiyRncy047-WAyIm4a4WudrzijhdiNIrh8ToGeuoki5SUtJW6lD_jrha\" style=\"-webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad); border: none; transform: rotate(0.00rad);\" width=\"358\" /></span></div>\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: center;\">\\n<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Above: </span><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The immediate view after stepping out of the airport in Cape Town. </span></div>\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt;\">\\n<br /></div>\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt;\">\\n<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Unfortunately, Cape Town’s beauty is also a sad story because the government used its beauty as a weapon. During Apartheid, Cape Town’s beauty created the blueprint for spatial segregation. The government relocated people depending on the color of their skin. Expectedly, the most beautiful part of Cape Town, the city, was reserved for the whites, and other ethnicities were pushed out of the city. These effects of systematic approach to use nature as a divisive force is still apparent today, as the racial demographics of the residents in the city and outside the city have not changed . While I was on top of Table Mountain, I wished everyone could see the view that I saw; I would never think to keep the view away from anyone. &nbsp;</span></div>\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt;\">\\n<br /></div>\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt;\">\\n<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">I have met so many people, who are incredibly rich in culture, and realizing that the natural beauty of this country is privy to a select population, which does not include them and is nowhere near the majority of South Africa’s population, is such a shame. It is terribly ironic how people can traveling thousands of miles to see these sights, but those living right here cannot. What’s even more ironic is that it’s the locals who create this functional paradise for the tourists to enjoy. As a tourist, I’ve become more aware of this power dynamic, and it does come with an unspoken set of responsibilities and thoughts of appreciation and understanding that I did not have before this trip. </span></div>\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt;\">\\n<br /></div>\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: center;\">\\n<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><img height=\"154\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wvB65Xy1i5TeJidO1SeuNHUlJkivWhiPhsnGdcQk2qD87jghz99KytMQWpd57mgw33ro7YkeloPf-SqA14wMzgb36w5k-ZTxPf7FmtkBtFX7Ahqe-500AD_4jNvEj9qYrztlxSuA\" style=\"-webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad); border: none; transform: rotate(0.00rad);\" width=\"274\" /></span><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"> &nbsp;</span></div>\\n<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-e1eec092-e15d-0492-942a-40857fa2cb54\"></span><br />\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: center;\">\\n<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Above:</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"> Penguins at the Cape. </span></div>\\n',\n",

The right to sanitation was an issue that I thought, in my naivety, were addressed when I read the Bill of Rights at the Apartheid Museum. I didn’t think or expect the issues to be solved, but I thought there would be a conscious effort on the government to be working towards equality among all its people regardless of race, socioeconomic status, or any other social determinant. Additionally, I could never have guessed the severity and political complexity of this issue. I simply don’t understand why humans keep degrading other humans.</span></div>\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt;\">\\n<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Townships and informal settlements lack a sanitation system; one aspect is the lack of proper toilets. Modern toilets that were recently built by the government are unenclosed; other toilets are temporary (like the ones you see above) locked and labeled to the household it belongs to. Sometimes, many households share one toilet. Then, there are areas with no toilets whatsoever, so residents have to use buckets and plastic bags. This toilet system is often referred to as “flying toilets”, as residents will then throw their waste towards the wetlands.</span></div>\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt;\">\\n<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">It should go without saying that every human being should have right to privacy when defecating. Such a deprivation to this basic right is more than just a deprivation, it’s an attack on one’s dignity. On top of dealing with the every day stench and discomfort, these communities have to face an additional embarrassment to need to bring this to the public eye. The fact that the country’s sewage situation must be brought upon national mainstream media and political attention is quite baffling to those of us living in first-world countries. The progressive social movement surrounding their basic right to sanitation is gravely needed. The Toilet Wars shed a transparent light to this issue and also illustrates how for such a seemingly basic necessity, the required action it will take for resolutions that will bring forth justice will be a complex and long-term process. </span></div>\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: center;\">\\n<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: red; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><img height=\"279\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/OGVHamxR5ThMqgMB6fqADHvkqU6SsVhGMyFhyfl5RjzM5oihgGCqdj4jiTh5BQpV1267QJoaObrGCz9xWmfVyyxkT0drcWu_6Tge6FAG-R8HEYgETbwoXRp9T7Oi2VBFoKtKFizw\" style=\"-webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad); border: none; transform: rotate(0.00rad);\" width=\"301\" /></span></div>\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\">\\n<br /></div>\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt;\">\\n<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Yet, the shitty situation does not just stop at the toilets but continues through the lack of a sewer system (pictured above) and the lack of service delivery (pictured below). Garbage and feces then collect in streams of narrow inlets and flow right through neighborhoods where people are supposed to live. Thinking about life at home, I reflect upon the “No Littering” signs, and the fact that in order to have those signs, a proper waste disposal system must be in place, which is absent here. Toilets, service delivery, and the sewage system are all aspects of my daily life that I never thought of as a privilege. In our germaphobic society where many public facilities reek of cleaning chemicals and Purell dispensers are attached to walls and purposefully made to fit into a handbag or on a keychain, this contrast leaves me not only unable to imagine living amidst the pollution but also extremely grateful for the sanitation system that I have and have never had to fight for or think twice about. </span></div>\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\">\\n<br /></div>\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: center;\">\\n<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><img height=\"198\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/IJ9FxnNKmzJ-Ny6qZx9_gMatSbHZ5dBzsQmlUlfroGhBFxIwF2P52N-Xg68t-15X9EWJUF0GYL10oXF9utDzIzhbzwTGz7FRBW1bz50Fjyi3Ain7hZpGKKWXu5OfRmlfqPUa56aV\" style=\"-webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad); border: none; transform: rotate(0.00rad);\" width=\"514\" /></span></div>\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\">\\n<br /></div>\\n<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-e1eec092-e15c-408a-889d-35dc95644398\"></span><br />\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\">\\n<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></div>\\n',\n",

Beautiful, right? That’s what I would think too. Unfortunately, the water and the sand dunes you see are actually toxic and radioactive. Even worse, children, who are unsupervised because their caregiver must go into town and work, swim in this water and play on the dunes. In addition, this community that lives right next to this site suffers from high rates of asthma. Many children are born with birth defects, and there are multiple cases of cerebral palsy. You may be wondering now: Who lives near these dumps? Why would they choose to live here? Well that would be the communities the government displaced during apartheid and still haven’t relocated. And as for choice - that’s the last thing they have. Still beautiful? Beautifully toxic.</span></div>\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\">\\n<br /></div>\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt;\">\\n<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">It has been a week since arriving in Johannesburg. Today, David led a tour on the environmental consequences mining has brought to the communities closest to these sites. Environmental injustice is rampant when it comes to the mining industry in South Africa. Currently, there are 6,000 abandoned mines, and not a single one has been closed properly. Corporations simply walk away when gold is found – that’s almost like eating all of the marshmallows in the Lucky Charm cereal and then leaving the rest for whoever reaches for the box next. But unlike leaving a box of tasteless cereal, leaving mines create huge safety and health risks to the nearby communities. </span></div>\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt;\">\\n<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">I get mad when my siblings don’t clean up after themselves, and I can’t even fathom how I respond if I lived in these communities. As long as I can remember, I was always taught to clean up after myself, and it’s sad to see how such simple lessons become forgotten when greed and wealth enter the equation. </span></div>\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt;\">\\n<br /></div>\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt;\">\\n<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Within the community, children with cerebral palsy are often hidden, and doctors do not tell parents that it is cerebral palsy. While the government acknowledges that the mines contributes to health issues, it’s quite hard to prove that it is solely the mines. In addition, while there are many laws that are supposed to protect people from the mining industry like the distance mines must be from communities and schools, this is far from the case. We walked by a mine that was right next to a school and there wasn’t even any signage or a fence. Moreover, it’s important to note that these mines and the city are separated by a road, which emphasizes the separation between the races and the classes. The apartheid laws may be over, but the social enforcements are still strong.</span></div>\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt;\">\\n<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span></div>\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt;\">\\n<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">For me, what was most shocking was how similar the gold industry in South Africa and the oil and gas industry in the United States acted. Both have horrendous environmental impacts such as contaminating the water and disrupting the natural ecosystem, both hold enormous political power, and both hit people in the lowest socioeconomic bracket the hardest.</span></div>\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt;\">\\n<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span></div>\\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\\n<a href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/GpFab2VCkaRcrvKXJmEwRXKq4okoQ-VV00N3mKhcOnezYr2l2O0KoVdJYQ_xux0Z-lfPgL3rNDS4AQ3cMT7g65oClmv-NyiHFyFFyb2QVa9irGqVUoxIMmlz9JayLaq8VmhoKuHc\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/GpFab2VCkaRcrvKXJmEwRXKq4okoQ-VV00N3mKhcOnezYr2l2O0KoVdJYQ_xux0Z-lfPgL3rNDS4AQ3cMT7g65oClmv-NyiHFyFFyb2QVa9irGqVUoxIMmlz9JayLaq8VmhoKuHc\" style=\"border: none; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 36pt; transform: rotate(0rad); white-space: pre-wrap;\" width=\"400\" /></a></div>\\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\">\\n<br /></div>\\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\">\\n<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-e1eec092-e157-d58c-2952-1462eea747fa\"></span></div>\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt;\">\\n<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">In the picture above, the tire tracks and the holes that have been dug up are actually people coming to take sand to turn into mud to make roofs, which then leads to the members of the household exposed to asbestos.

Therefore, there is a very clear pattern in the mines. However, in the picture above, the mines have been excavated straight across, which indicates that they aren’t really mining for gold. In fact, the mining industry is also intertwined with the mafia and as a front for illegal activity. </span></div>\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt;\">\\n<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"></span></div>\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\">\\n<br /></div>\\n<div>\\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 14.666666984558105px; text-indent: 48px; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Sophie Gong</span></div>\\n<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-e1eec092-e156-09ab-791b-f47352e2ae9a\"></span>',\n",

Siyakhana, meaning “building up one another” in\\nZulu, is a garden reformed from wasteland formerly used for not else but crime.&nbsp; The director of this initiative, Professor\\nMichael Rudolph, focused on the public health implications of projects like the\\nSiyakhana Garden, envisioning the garden to be a gateway to a more nutritious\\nSouth Africa.&nbsp; The provision of healthier\\nfoods and better means to prepare it derived from the research done at the\\nSiyakhana Garden could help to lower the nation’s high diabetes rates.&nbsp; Additionally, the garden represents a safe\\nhaven for the community where people can walk through, schools can visit and\\nlearn, university students can get job experience, and community members can\\nvolunteer.&nbsp; Some sustainable developments\\nof the space that can be incorporated elsewhere by the public are solar panels made\\nwith few resources, waterless bathrooms with flush-less toilets which could be\\na revolutionary means of mass water conservation, the use of cats for rodent\\ncontrol instead of poison, and the development of 1 meter agricultural box plots that could be\\nutilized regardless of space restrictions of city living.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\\n<a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-b1-Vrx9Pw5I/WU6wR7u9OEI/AAAAAAAAlwc/f7DEG_AxvJkTQxMy4d4cve_gho_rkBSXwCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_3890.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1067\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"425\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-b1-Vrx9Pw5I/WU6wR7u9OEI/AAAAAAAAlwc/f7DEG_AxvJkTQxMy4d4cve_gho_rkBSXwCLcBGAs/s640/IMG_3890.JPG\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>\\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\\n<a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ptr4ymWpNZA/WU6wTC7ybVI/AAAAAAAAlwg/UTQ2b7Xm3m8IcBRQ3qOfrOXHvZ963hlqwCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_3901.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1067\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"425\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ptr4ymWpNZA/WU6wTC7ybVI/AAAAAAAAlwg/UTQ2b7Xm3m8IcBRQ3qOfrOXHvZ963hlqwCLcBGAs/s640/IMG_3901.JPG\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>\\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody>\\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TWvQm4wQ_eY/WU6wQgDUJ6I/AAAAAAAAlwY/arJk5LYjULQJm1qIu6bu9XZA_lytNZR7wCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_3884.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1067\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"425\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TWvQm4wQ_eY/WU6wQgDUJ6I/AAAAAAAAlwY/arJk5LYjULQJm1qIu6bu9XZA_lytNZR7wCLcBGAs/s640/IMG_3884.JPG\" width=\"640\" /></a></td></tr>\\n<tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Siyakhana Garden</td></tr>\\n</tbody></table>\\n<br />\\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .5in;\">\\n<span style=\"font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%;\">Weeks later, in Cape\\nTown, we visited the Philippi Horticultural Area.&nbsp; This area consisted of farmland comparatively\\nmore vast than that of Siyakhana Garden which the PHA is battling the city over\\nto prevent the rezoning of.&nbsp; Nazeer\\nSonday, a leader of the PHA’s activism, spoke to us about how a farm is an\\necosystem, and single crop fields are basically deserts.&nbsp; These principles are reflected in the rows of\\ndiverse crops planted next to each other at the PHA.

Organized chronologically, the Apartheid Museum provided much\\nnecessary context for our learning on the rest of our trip.&nbsp; Prior to entry into the museum, our tickets\\nrandomly branded us as “whites” and “non-whites,” and we briefly went through\\nseparate doors and followed different paths, a powerful means to introduce the\\ncontents of the museum, enough to set the mood and provide insight to the\\nmicro-injustices faced in everyday spaces under the apartheid rule, while\\nrefraining from making people relive the experience entirely. The inside of the\\nmuseum, crafted intentionally to feel like a prison, consisted of a dark,\\nwindowless space of brick and metal fences to symbolize the oppression and lack\\nof freedom that came with apartheid.&nbsp; One\\nof the most memorable parts of the museum was the room with the nooses hanging\\nfrom the ceiling remembering the killing of jailed political dissenters which\\nwere put on record as “suicide by hanging.”&nbsp;\\nThe location of this museum right next to the Gold Reef City Theme Park\\nfelt like a strange juxtaposition, but overall, this represented one of many\\ninformative experiences.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody>\\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pJytu95r0vc/WU1KkPaHxoI/AAAAAAAAltc/nTA-0J6ySIobQz5kbhzKRS07luAptilYgCLcBGAs/s1600/ap.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"355\" data-original-width=\"531\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pJytu95r0vc/WU1KkPaHxoI/AAAAAAAAltc/nTA-0J6ySIobQz5kbhzKRS07luAptilYgCLcBGAs/s400/ap.jpg\" width=\"400\" /></a></td></tr>\\n<tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Entrance to Apartheid Museum</td></tr>\\n</tbody></table>\\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\">\\n<br /></div>\\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\">\\n<span style=\"font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The\\nnext museum we visited in Johannesburg was a former prison at Constitution Hill.\\nThis museum differed from the Apartheid Museum in that the space itself was the\\nactual site of past injustices. We spent most of our time here learning about\\nthe Number Four prison cell, utilized for the non-white inmates which shows how\\nracial distinctions carry over even in prison.&nbsp;\\nThe racial power structures were further maintained in the amount and\\nquality of food white prisoners received, as compared to the lesser and lower\\nquality meals that coloured (mixed black and white) and black prisoners got. People\\nlike Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela spent time in the Constitution Hill\\nprison.&nbsp; I thought the most interesting\\npart of Constitutional Hill is that right next to the old prison stands the new\\nConstitutional Court, the highest court in South Africa built in 1995.&nbsp; The reconstruction of this space at the end\\nof apartheid recognizes the past injustices of the old court and represents a\\nphysical means of expressing a reform in attitudes toward justice.&nbsp; The court utilizes bricks from the old prison\\nin its structure as a reminder to learn from the past to build a better future.<o:p></o:p></span><br />\\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto;

Lastly, we toured the District Six\\nMuseum near the center of Cape Town.&nbsp; District\\nSix, an area formerly populated by mostly black and coloured South Africans,\\nwas declared a white group area during apartheid, which prompted forced\\nremovals and demolitions for the transformation, justified by the necessity of “redemption”\\ndue to high disease rates and prevalence of crime such as gambling, sex work,\\nand shebeening.&nbsp; After District Six was\\ndeclared a white group area, 60,000 people were displaced between 1968 and\\n1980.&nbsp; To me, the museum felt like a\\nmemorial shrine, with remnants of things found in the rubble of District Six\\nsuch as old furniture, toys, and photographs from people’s homes.&nbsp; The space represented a combination of\\nremembrance and history, with quilts and poems from District Six residents as\\nwell as maps and articles pasted on the walls.&nbsp;\\nThis museum was the most powerful to me because it made tangible the way\\napartheid uprooted people from their lives and destroyed their homes and\\ncommunities.&nbsp;

       "   'content': \"Mathia Griffith<br />\\n<br />\\nWhile being in South Africa we have visited many markets, specifically while in Johannesburg. In each market visited there were many women selling skin bleach and other skin whitening and brightening products. Upon reflecting on this it has made me consider how globalization and westernization have negative impacts on people of color specifically in this context and what that does to the community.<br />\\n<br />\\nIn every market, as I've stated&nbsp;skin bleach could be found, there were different brands as well as lotions, soaps, and&nbsp;different creams. When asking a tour guide of ours about the skin bleach he shared that skin bleaching is popular among the women because they want to be lighter. This is an&nbsp;idea also popular in the&nbsp;United States where those deemed the most beautiful are white and this creates colorism within the black community.&nbsp;South Africa the majority of the population is black, and for this reason it was difficult for me to grasp the self hate within the black community in the country, however, in both the&nbsp; US and South African context those in power who hold the standard of beauty are white. <br />\\n<br />\\nIn addition to the racial makeup of the country globalization also makes it so that&nbsp;black Africans receive the same anti black messages as the US. Eurocentric beauty standards are spread internationally which leads to things such as skin bleaching in black communities, comparatively countries like Jamaica where the population is mostly black there is also an increase of skin bleaching as countries become more westernized and the people get connected through social media and T.V. seeing these negative messages. <br />\\n<br />\\nWhile countries being connected on an international level due to globalization&nbsp;is positive one cannot ignore the negative affect is has on non white people. Feelings of self hate arise when they cannot and do not fit into the mold of this European white standard. More than just receiving negative anti-black messages from media, little black children are seen with princess backpacks with solely white princesses with long flowing hair and I have seen&nbsp;children as young as six having braid extensions. Young black children also receive these negative messages and also receive toys and accessories not representative of their culture or appearance. I saw many princess backpacks with Ariel, and Cinderella but not one of Tiana, the only black princess, however that back pack is hard enough to find in America so it only makes sense that it wouldn't be around as much as the other backpacks.<br />\\n<br />\\nOverall globalization, while though it does good, proves harmful to non white groups. Anti black messages are so powerful where in a majority black country black skin is still deemed ugly. They are not beautiful due to dealing with racist minority in their country while also receiving these messages from western and European messages and from there stems self hate, tied in with the lack of representation from other countries as well. In this way globalization negatively affects black people.\",\n",

       "   'content': \"This dialogue was one of the most educational experiences of my life and I feel so privileged to have had the opportunity to visit and learn about South Africa in the manner that I did. The nature of our trip gave me the opportunity to have a more intimate and realistic experience in South Africa that I could have on any tourism tour. I appreciated that this program gave us enough time to get to know and have some familiarity with the neighborhoods in which we were staying and to every point think about our impact and relationship to those around us. Having local guides at every location allowed us to hear perspectives and experiences that I could have never learned or understood without being there physically and talking to people. Most of all, the ability to form relationships with people like Sibu and Nikita who were willing to share their experiences with us allowed me to form a connection with this country that is much more meaningful than anything I could read in a textbook.<br />\\n<br />\\nOne of the greatest lessons I want to take from this experience is humbleness. There is so much of the world that I have seen and do not know or understand. There are people in so many places striving for many different things and almost all of them are good. Before having the opportunity to really speak to people living in extreme poverty, I think some part of me was always reducing their experiences to tragedy. And I don't want to undermine the legitimacy of the struggles they face, but I also now realize that those communities and the people who reside there are much more complex than their economic situation, and they have ways of living, learning and understanding the world that provide something unique and important to those around them. The world is such a big place that it is so easy to generalize places and cultures, but the complexity of individual lives in so many different places always amazes me.<br />\\n<br />\\nOne thing that I also want to work on after this trip is to look for solutions and ways to relate to people before looking for ways to criticize. I think it is a very common problem in activist circles that our desire to seem knowledgeable and be performative undermines our ability to affect change. I do think that I have missed opportunities to have important conversations with people because it is difficult for me to get past what I view as mistakes in language or problematic views to relate to people and form understanding relationships. I often scoff at the criticism of the left that says we can sometimes be too elitist to relate to average people and have the conversations that promote understanding. I still am very skeptical of asking people who are already oppressed to do the additional labor of educating those around them. Still, as someone who is getting ready to go into academics - arguably the most elitist field that exists, I think I need to be very conscious about making an effort to give people the benefit of the doubt and to focus on understanding. I truly do believe that most people are good people and are well-intentioned, and that conversations are the number one tool that we have to affect change in the world. That is something that I really need to hold on as I delve further into educational opportunities that most people will never have the privilege of experiencing. I want to make sure I hold on to what I learned on this trip - that my formal education doesn't hold any superiority to what people everyday are learning through lived experiences. At the end of the day, I hope that even though I am going into academics, I am going to continue to find ways to learn from the world around me and not only textbooks.\",\n",

In relation to space I believe that the forcing of black African&nbsp;people into spaces that are poorer with little resources has created this more territorial and violent behaviors in these same spaces.</span></div>\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt;\">\\n<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: \\'Times New Roman\\'; font-size: 12pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">When trying to get an uber a group of men, who&nbsp;I learned were meter taxi drivers, scared off&nbsp;my uber driver in telling him not to pick&nbsp;me up. Because these men told&nbsp;my uber driver not to pick us up he left us there.&nbsp;I wasn\\'t&nbsp;sure why he left&nbsp;me or what was going on but&nbsp;I ended up having to find someone else to help us get home and protect us from the meter taxi men. The next day while discussing with our guide of Johannesburg,&nbsp;Sibu, he told us that there is a lot of anger in the country toward uber in general, and people do not want it around. Meter taxi drivers are angry because of the competition that has come from uber and they take out their frustrations on uber drivers and the users. </span></div>\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt;\">\\n<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: \\'Times New Roman\\'; font-size: 12pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">Sibu said that often meter taxi drivers will follow the uber driver and their passenger if they are on meter taxi territory and have even killed uber drivers and passengers out of losing customers. I experienced another uber incident when I called an uber and&nbsp;then when&nbsp;I opened the door&nbsp;the driver&nbsp;sounded nervous and told me to get out and he’ll pick&nbsp;me up down the block because he doesn’t trust the meter taxi men. As I shut the door to let my uber driver backup down the block I noticed two meter taxis back up near me and follow my movements.&nbsp;I had to wait near a bar until&nbsp;I felt that&nbsp;I could run to get the uber down the block and the whole ride&nbsp;I was&nbsp;paranoid and looking behind me. It was evident that meter taxis do have a problem with Uber drivers and that Uber drivers are aware of it. They are&nbsp;even willing to give up costumers because of how afraid they are of the meter taxi drivers.&nbsp;</span></div>\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt;\">\\n<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: \\'Times New Roman\\'; font-size: 12pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">It is interesting to consider why people feel so strongly that they have to resort to violence. There are already a lack of resources and high competition in order to make a living and when that is threatened often people get violent, and may not see other alternatives. The small amount of space given to black people in South Africa has been used to help people make livings, prior to uber the meter taxis had a good business however now more people are using uber because it is more affordable. The lack of economic opportunities and resources has made the competition more serious in this area. Inherent flaws in a capitalist system can also be interpreted by theses events because competition is the essence of the system. A society driven by competition and profit is the cause of violence. It is even worse when there is a lack of resources to compete over, this is the reason that marginalized groups are the ones most vulnerable to the negative consequences of a capitalist society. Violence is the result of trying to survive and provide for yourself and family, that’s why it makes sense that the most stratified groups would be this territorial. They do not want the competition and with resources already scarce comparatively to the white people in South Africa of a higher socioeconomic status, they need to protect what they seem to have lost control over, their customers.</span></div>\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt;\">\\n<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: \\'Times New Roman\\'; font-size: 12pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">While overall, this is showing a flaw in capitalism it shows a flaw in how space and resources are allocated. Without spaces of more economic opportunity competition and violence will always be present at larger scales.</span></div>\\n<br /></b><b></b><i></i><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><strike></strike><br />',\n",

In each city remnants of the country\\'s apartheid past can be seen in everyday interactions and in observing social dynamics among people of varying social locations. Overall through being in these two cities exploring how the economy shaped the city also displays how the economy shaped racial dynamics from apartheid to present, allowing us to analyze inclusion and exclusion in terms of the right to the city during this dialogue.</span></div>\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\">\\n<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: \\'Times New Roman\\'; font-size: 12pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: \\'Times New Roman\\'; font-size: 12pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">While studying in Johannesburg we learned about its economic history. Johannesburg was known for having a lot of gold and still is, which is why the province it is in is called Gauteng, making a direct reference to the amount of gold in the area. The mining that was done in Johannesburg was by Black miners. While on an excursion to see mines we also learned that there are also illegal minors that continue to do that work which are still black miners. The mining done by black labor was able to boost Johannesburg\\'s economy and by seeing the present day mining we can see that the legacies of the past hold true in the present, however in Johannesburg there is still more of a mix of social and racial dynamics than in Cape Town. Upon entering Cape Town it was clear that it was not as integrated as Johannesburg comparatively and we learned that originally during apartheid it was structured to keep non whites out. This did not work as white people in Cape Town needed Black labor in order to do the service jobs and work they did not wish to do, as a result many Black people had to commute to the area and this still hold true today where many of the black service workers of the white areas do not live where they work. Due to the fact that in Johannesburg Black labor was needed outside of the city that could be the reason why currently the city could become more integrated whereas in Cape Town there was and is still a specific need for Black and Brown labor to serve the white area within the city.</span></div>\\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\">\\n<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: \\'Times New Roman\\'; font-size: 12pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: \\'Times New Roman\\'; font-size: 12pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">Johannesburg’s economic past made it so that while many Black laborers are still tied to the mines they are able to enter the city at different levels of professional work as well as white people also holding different positions. Cape Town specifically depends on Black labor and for this reason it seems to be harder for non whites to have a right to the city when all that is valued is their labor in serving white people. Black labor made these cities what they are during apartheid and continue to make them what they are today. Contrasting the two visited this is why many Black Africans we spoke to see Cape Town as very exclusionary, because racial and social dynamics have stayed very much the same while the demographics of the city have not.
