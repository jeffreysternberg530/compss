    "### *Investigating the Marketing of Place-based Commodities: A Topic Model of AirBnB Listings*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "The following computaional essay attempts to use computational text methods in order to investigate the concepts of city image and its use as a marketing tool both for cities as well as place-based commodities (in this case AirBnBs). By running a topic model on AirBnB listing data for the City of Boston, the author attempts to pull out themes relating to a greater existing and constructed city image. Using the emergence of this form of topic as a guideline for determining how many topics to derive from the data set, the author investigates the aspects of place-based commodities that are invoked in different listings and attempts to determine how these topics are differentially invoked based on geographic area of the listing, whether city image is invoked more in areas proximate to downtown and CBDs (central business districts) while those farther out use different marketing topics to draw potential consumers. The author finds that city-image is invoked in more than one dimension, producing two different topics which are invoked in different areas for different purposes. This study hopes to open up new avenues for the study of city-image using computational methods while at the same time looks at the emergence of the newly forming place-based commodity of the AirBnB. \n",

    "### The City Image: From Mental Map to Marketing Tool \n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of the city image was first put forth by Kevin Lynch in his book *The Image of the City* (1960). Lynch, an urban planner and designer, defined the city image as \"the 'public images,' the common mental pictures carried by large numbers of a city's inhabitants: areas of agreement which might be expected to appear in the interaction of a single physical reality, a common culture, and a basic physiological nature\" (pg.7). For Lynch, the city image is the symbolic collection of each individual's experiences and associations with the city, whose clarity orients and makes possible the use of the city by large amounts of people for a variety of different purposes. Lynch saw it as the job of the city planner to work to clarify the city image, the shared and agreed upon mental map of the city, in order to make the city inhabital and useable by the largest collection of people. He saw the construction of the city image as an on-going, open-ended process whose shape is changed by each new experience of the people interacting with the built environment, and every new addition to the built environment prompting new interactions from the citizens of the city. \n",
    "\n",
    "Scholars of political economy (Harvey 1989, 1992; Logan and Molotch 1987; Logan 1976; Molotch 1976)  have taken the concept of the city image and put it center-stage to the actions of the neo-liberal city. Harvey Molotch, in *The City as Growth Machine* (1976) sees the construction of an image of the city as being one of the chief sites of strategy and importance for city elites. City elites attempt to control what city image is being broadcasted by their control and alliance with city newspapers and media institutions, to strategically attract capital and oppurtunities for growth from outside the city. David Harvey (1989, 1992) identifies this trend as emerging in the economic and strategic shift in cities from managerialism of Keynesianism to the entrepreneurialism of Neo-Liberalism. For Harvey, once national tax revenues ceased to be redistributed around the country, cities had to make up the gap by becoming entrepreneurs, by attracting industry and talent to support its operating revenues. It is in this phase that the city image shifts from being an organically produced subject of city planning, to a tool for entrepreneurialism. The successful marketing of a city becomes tantamount in ensuring the future survival and success of a city in the long run. \n",
    "\n",
    "The city image, once placed within city marketing schemes sparked by competition between cities for industry and talent, becomes a cultural object whose content is censored, curated, and produced by a small segment of the city's population, the growth coalition elite. The image constructed is no longer on the product of all the inhabitants of the city, but a fractured series of symbolic and social networks (Sevin 2014) utilized differently by different groups. The emergence of the creative city (Florida 2001, 2003) and the global city (Sassen 2001) provided prominent, globally circulated schema and sets of criteria. City governments and growth coalitions attempted to construct their city images, through both urban planning and media circuation, to become legible under the banners of the creative and/or global city. These images are circulated in order to attract populations that do not live there, to create new sites of orientation which offer up the city as a site of desire, of wish fulfillment, among them the cretive class and global expatriates and elites (Vanolo 2015). City images become a key mechanism in converting the use value of place into exchange value, into commodifying the urban space of the city into a consumable commodity (Lefebvre 1991). "

    "### Accesing the Authentic, Congealed City Image\n",
    "\n",
    "These city images are both the result of, and influenced by cities' long social, cultural, and political-economic histories. These histories both congeal into a form of city character which leads cities down somewhat path-dependent urban development trajectories, as well as become the raw material from which new and attractive city images can be constructed (Molotch, Freudenburg & Paulsen 2000). As cities come into increasing and constant competition with one another, they look for any edge they can gain against one another, with authenticity, or factors that distinguish one city from another and make it unique, becoming a driving factor. It is in this congealed city character that city marketers search for an edge, both drawing from and reconstructing new histories of the city in question, activating certain populations' relations to the city and silencing others, constructing false but consumable authenticities (Zukin 2008, 2009, 2011). Ephemeral and recurrents events and festivals become new sources of authenticity that serve to also link a continuity in the city image of a city while at the same time open the city's image open to continued fluctuation (Yuan & Chong 2007).\n",
    "\n",
    "City images fluctuate overtime from both the actions of city residents, as well as continual rebranding and highlighting of different histories, amenities, industries, and cultural offerings put forward by chambers of commerce and growth coalition leaders. The question becomes: Where do city images exist? How are they accesible? How do they change over time? What do people look for in cities? How does this determine what types of city images are being constructed? Through what mediums are they produced? At what level do they operate? A few studies have attempted to capture and meaure city image through interviews, looking at what residents and tourists look for and define as important to them, and using these measures in following surveys to measure which of these factors is present in different cities (Gliboa et al 2015). These studies conduct market research on those they see as the consumers of the city to determine what they look for in cities, as well as how they currently view any given city that the surveys are conducted in. These studies do not lend themselves well to studying city images across time, in accessing congealed examples of city image that are locked away in media representations, texts, actual marketing materials, and histories inaccessible by survey research. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is my project to look for new ways to begin to study where city images are being produced and crafted, and looking at how these city images are circulated. It is the creation of city images and their circulation that remains an area of little investigation. I believe that any type of record and media object which represents the city, circulates, and becomes an entry point determining how people both outside and inside the city conceive of it is just as important as everyday understandings of it. Others, like Mike Davis (2006) covers the cultural history of Los Angeles by looking at booster materials as well as litertaure and film movements occuring both within and about Los Angeles to look at how the idea of what Los Angeles is, its city image, has shifted over time. His project represents the inspiration for looking at these kind of materials to see where these images are being constructed and looking at how and where they circulate. \n",
    "\n",
    "As city image becomes further commodified and marketed, its sources of production are proliferating. One of the largest sources of commoditization of space that rely on the marketing city image as a source of competetitive advantage are AirBnb Listings. AirBnB listings take a place-based commodity (an apartment, home, room, etc) and attempt to sell it to those looking to make use of the city. The value of an AirbBnB is largely determined by where the commodity is located, and what it is connected to. AirBnB listings then are exmaples of commodity marketing that directly engage with and actively shape an image of the city to outside consumers. As such, I beleive that AirBnB listings can provide us a unique window into looking into what types of place based authenticity are being highlighted and selected to be associated with the city image.

    "### The Project, Data, and Operationalization\n",
    "\n",
    "My project will investigate and operationalize the concept of city image through looking at AirBnb listings for Boston. AirBnB publically releases its data, which I pulled from its websites' data page. I am treating the AirBnB listings as attempts by individuals to market their place-based assets/commodities (in the form of room's in their dwelling, their apartments, houses, neighborhood, and city) to a market of travellers and mobile individuals looking for lodging.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am particularly interested in how these listings are creating/reflecting an Image of Boston as a city, defining how the city is being marketed uniquely as compared to other cities. I chose Boston as it is the city in which I currently reside, making me more able and likely to identify what material in the listings connect to and represent unique attributes about the city in particular. While the listing data, as it is, includes place-based information, it does so on a variety of different levels, including the apartment and amenities level, transit, neighborhood and other levels. Part of this is crafted by the fields AirBnB hosts are given by the company and listing template to fill. This serves as a natural constraint on the types of information that will be used in any given listing. There is no separate field for marketing Boston, or any given city for that matter, but I hypothesize that particular city level descriptions and information will be lying somewhere in the listing itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be operationalizing city image by running a topic model on the listing text data. DiMaggio et al (2013) define topic modeling algorithms as \"a suite of machine learning methods for discovering hidden thematic structure in large collections of documents. With a collection of documents as input, a topic model can produce a set of interpretable ‘‘topics’’ (i.e., groups of words that are associated under a single theme) and assess the strength with which each document exhibits those topics\" (Pg.577). I will be using the specific topic modeling method of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), producing topics or themes. Dimaggio et al describe a topic as being \"formally defined as a distribution over a vocabulary. Terms that are prominent within a topic are those that tend to occur in documents together more frequently than one would expect by chance\" (pg.578). \n",
    "\n",
    "The number of topics pulled from the corpus for analysis is something determined ahead of time. There is no real rule for determining how many topics to set in advance, the general rule being to run multiple topic models with different numbers of topics pre-specificed and choosing that model whose topics are the most interpretable and understandable by the researcher and their prior knolwedge of the subject area. Being that topic models are inductively derived, it is hard for most reserchers to be able to determine ahead of time what they want to be looking for. In my case, however, I know one of the topics that I want to see emerging from the data: the city image. I will be operationalizing and defining the concept of the city image by looking for a topic which has Boston unique location and place based information, providing words that cannot be associated with any other city. Being that my listing data is bound to contain city-specific information, ehing the nature of the commodity being sold, it is reasonable to assume that a topic corresponding to this operationalization of city image should emerge from the data. My measure and rule of thumb for determining whether the number of topics chosen is good or not will rely on when I see this city image topic(s) emerging clearly and crystallizing. When I see this, it becomes more a task of seeing whether the other topics presented are legible. If they are, this will serve as my topic model.     "

    "### My Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "The topic model on this listing data will be used to investigate what themes are coming across in these listings, whether city-image will be represented in any of the topics (in terms of city-level unique words related together), as well as looking at what different ways these place-based commodities are being marketed, AirBnB's themselves representing a new type of commodity that has only recently come into existence in a newly produced market. There is also meta-data for these listings provided in a different csv, that I will merge in, that will allow me to look at how these topics are distributed by geographic location, in terms of neighbourhood, as well as price.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hypothesize that the city-image topic, if found, will be present more in some areas than others, most likely in more geographically central, downtown areas, neighbourhoods, and more commercial districts. I hypothesize that more geographically peripheral and residential neighbourhoods will have to market themselves differently, in terms of the lodging itself, proximity to transit and other more generic amenities. I also hypothesize that city image will be measurable on a number of levels, with each thematic level identified in the topic model telling us about different dimensions of Boston's City Image and Character."

    "\n",
    "The dataset seperates each listing out into different sections and cells, including \"summary\", \"space\", \"description\", 'neighborhood_overview\", \"notes\", \"transit\", \"access\", \"interaction\", and 'house rules\". These different sections correspond to different spaces within the html listing page provided to AirBnB hosts to fill out for potential users. Many of these sections are empty for some listings, and some are repretitive. \n",
    "\n",
    "I filled in NaN cells for each of these sections with a blank space, and then concatenated the cells into one text listing, these combined text listings being the raw data and corpus that my topic model will be generated from. I then merged this dataset with another which listed meta-data such as price, neighbourhood, etc. for each of the listing names referenced in the first data set, merging on these listing names, thereby providing myself with categories to organize and anlyze my data with farther down the line.

The question that remains is: to what extent is city image an important component of an airbnb's marketing toolkit? Is it a prominent part of how these place entrepreneurs sell their products? Or is the quality of the unit, the amenties offered, and the other themes represented in the other topics derived from the listings more prevalent?\n",

    "From the above results, it seems that Topic 4: Outside/Street Level Description had the highest prevalence, by a large amount, in the corpus in terms of word count devoted to it. It seems that those marketing their place-based commodities play up the generic aspects of utilities and consumption sites nearby, proximity and access to restaurants and transportation being high on the list for what sellers think buyers want.\n",

    "These are attempts to look at the distribution of these topics based on neighbourhood/geographic location, to see whether the geographic location of an airbnb property influences what types of market rents the seller plays up and tries to extract from it. The above findings show, that if we hold Topics 1 and 2 to represent city image, that the city character of a city is leveraged by airbnb's close to tourist and consumption sites, as well as centrally downtown located, while sites farther out attempt to leverage their proximity to economic and cultural institutions, institutions that people might be coming into town to link up to. We ahve also seen that city image is itself a fractured cultural product and form, being invoked along different axis based on who the city is being pitched towards, taking on in our topics both the dimensions of consumable authentic city character, as well as playing up creative city characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings don't represent an ending place, but an opening into how we can go about looking at the different dimensions of city image being created and circulated in different areas and contexts. By looking at place-based commodities in the form of airbnb's, I attempted to highlight areas in which city image is constantly being shaped and circulated in a way that affects the city on a big scale, that is not necessarily linked to formal growth coalition campaigns and machinations. City-image while becoming a marketing tool used to convert the use value of place into exchange value, is being pulled back into the realm of decentralized production. What I mean by this is that city marketing in the 1970's seemed to be becoming more centralized, making city image a cultural product that was no longer something formed by all inhabitatnts of a city, but something decided by a small group of elites for their ends and purposes. With the advent of privately owned place-based commodities in the form of airbnb's, the grounds upon which this city image is invoked become determined by a larger plurality of decentralized actors. What has truly changed however is that city image is no longer necessarily the image of the city created and utilized by residents, but itself becomes a simulcrum, a fantasy image representing and courting the desires of those outside the city, creating an image of what the city wants itself to become. Further studies would attempt to further explore the ways that digital methods could be used to uncover the different dimensions of city image being evoked, its networks of circulation, and its endurance or fluctuation throughout time.  \n",

    "As far as limitiations go, my visualizations are a bit sloppy. They need to be sorted, organized, and played around with to be clean and interpretable. This is the next step in the project, determining how to do this, and analyzing and interpreting these analyses. I need to work on creating different visualizations to explore my questions, as well as coming up with, qualifying, and justifying my conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am also still grappling with how to choose how many topics to analyze and to determine whether they are interpretable, or whether the ways I interpret them are right or not. I have to make sure my topics are actually encompassing what I think they do, which will require running more models with different numbers of topics, and coming up with different and stronger interpretations for each topic for each model. I did run multiple topic models, but ran up against the problem of whether the number of topics became to large to readily interpret, or whether they were too few that they had many overlapping words being used. I also need to read up on ways to run a confirmation tests of some sort on findings and conclusions I draw, like a word count of pre-determined city-image terms relating to Boston to see whether my topics captured that well or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "This might take me the many more months to do so I want to stop here in terms of what I hoped to achieve by the end of this project. I might cotinue this project in the future where I would to explore the construction of an AirBnB as a new form of commodity more, looking specifically at its marketing and rent-extraction to understand this relatively new commodity form. I would like to look at how the presence of any of these topics correlates with the price given for these units. I could just make a correlation matrix to look if there is a realtionship. I could also run a simple regression to see what this relationship looks like for each topic with price as the dependent variable. I could control by dummy-coding for neighbourhood, which is a big determinant of real estate price. These regressions would more be a way of looking if there is a relationship as opposed to coming away with solid findings on the exact nature of these relationships. "
